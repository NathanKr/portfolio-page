<h2>Motivation</h2>
Any software developer \ software house need a portfolio page. You might take all ready implemented one like in WIX but as i like to implement it my self

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
I like the portfolio page <a href='http://findmatthew.com/'>here</a> so i am taking the design from there and doing the implementation my self

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nice UI</li>
<li>Responsive</li>
<li>Easy to add new project in the portfolio - seperation of concerns</li>
<li>This is only one page so i am not using react i use vanila js</li>
</ul>

<h2>Points of interest</h2>
<ul>
<li>In general projects_storage.js should be projects_storage.json but there was a problem reading the file using fetch. This problem can be fixed with proper development server as with react but i prefered in this small project to simply use js file</li>
</ul>
